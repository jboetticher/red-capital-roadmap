<List any additional contributions that you have made toward your team's
 completion of this project.  This might include, but is not limited to things
 like: organizing team communication, creating extra tests or dummy classes,
 assisting team members in any way, etc.>

I wrote some code to create a graph data structure with the backend code, but ultimately it was not
used in the final code because it would have interfered with the test code others had already written.
I also helped Kenneth fix errors in the CSV file.
